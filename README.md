# Game Engine Documentation
Architected a C++ game engine with a runtime reflection system to bind game properties and a JSON-based content pipeline, allowing game objects, components, and behaviors to be defined entirely in external data.

You can access the engine documentation [here](https://th3roadnottaken.github.io/GameEngineDocumentation/). The code for my game engine is private, but I can provide access on request.
